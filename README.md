# Travel-Tourism-Website

Brief introduction about a project:
Since tourism is one of the most significant industries in India, we aim to simplify it with
our project; helping people to spend a holiday at some of the most desirable holiday destinations.
With this site, we aim to handle the planning part while families can just focus of the fun part.
We will be using php/html for the front-end and php MyAdmin for the back-end. The
styling part will be done using CSS while the functionality will be added using JavaScript. We
plan on making it as user-friendly as possible, with preplanned packages and even custom
packages available which user can choose according to his preference.
Along with being one of the biggest industries in India, tourism is also the most profitable
one; especially with such exotic natural(Kashmir) and historical (Taj Mahal) tourist destinations.
Plus, for a family who has been through a stressful time lately, a holiday can be relaxing and
enjoyable.
 We will provide accommodation, transportation, ratings, photos and videos (of the
places to be visited via slide show). Places that we will cover in our trip will have historical
monuments ,coastal areas etc.
The customer can sign in/sign up and search for the tour packages. Customers can book easily through the site. And there are other features such as customers can check their Tour history and their issued tickets, and many more. And Admin can Create, Manage Packages, Manage bookings, issues, inquiries, pages. The design is pretty simple and the user wonâ€™t find it difficult to understand, use and navigate.
